                <h2>What is Shark Fin Trading?</h2>
                <p class="major">The origin of Shark Fin soup can be traced back to as early as the Sung Dynasty in China (AD 968). The emperor at that time used the delicacy to demonstrate his generosity, respect and status to his banquet guests.</p>
                <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1XqO4Bc3C2tBuLfcn7atz5W1fifAWcTrAThXBBc-KtXs&font=Default&lang=en&timenav_position=top&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
                <p class="major">The dish is one of the Big 4 (Albone, sea cucumber, Shark fin and fish maw) In Chinese cuisine, a series of dishes which represent prosperity, class and wealth in traditional Chinese culture.</p>
                <p class="major">Up till today, Shark Fin soup is seen as a “conspicuous consumption product” and face , meaning it is a public display of social status. The dish is most commonly served in Chinese weddings. The folklore says that if the bride marries
                    into a family without Shark fin soup on the wedding banquet, then she is marrying into a broke family. It is also served in baby showers and an elderly’s birthday celebration.</p>
                <p class="major">Shark fin soup is thickened soup made with chicken broth, accompanied by shark fin threads and shredded chicken. The price can range from $5 to $200 dollars depending on the type and style of the shark served.</p>
                <p class="major">Shark fin trade will never stop when there is demand in shark fins, especially in Asian countries such as China. Here is the brutal practice: A shark is caught and brought to the surface, its fins are sliced off, often while the animal
                    is still alive, and then the body thrown back overboard to drown, bleed to death or be eaten alive by other animals. Such Chinese convention has caused wide massacre among sharks. Quoting the statistics by Life Science, more than 73
                    million sharks are being killed each year.</p>

                <h2>Shark Fin Consumption in Hong Kong</h2>
                <p class="major">According to the statistics by Hong Kong Shark Foundation in 2016, over 98% of the 375 surveyed restaurants offered shark fin on their Chinese New Year menus. Only seven restaurants did not follow such convention:</p>
                <p class="major">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loong Yuen Cantonese Restaurant (Tsim Sha Tsui)</li>
                        <li>Paradise Dynasty (Causeway Bay)</li>
                        <li>Putien Restaurant (5 outlets)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="major">One out of five (Putien outlets) still provided one dish with shark fin on demand. Of the remaining two, one (Paradise Dynasty) did not offer shark fin as it served only Shanghainese cuisine and the other (Loong Yuen Cantonese Restaurant)
                    did not offer shark fin, due to environmental issues.</p>
                <p class="major">Only about 15% out of 2470 menus across nearly 400 restaurants were found to be free of shark fin. While for the 183 restaurants that had a complete set of menus available, only about 10% of them were shark free. Nearly 30 of them had
                    shark fin soup available on request secretly.</p>
                <p class="major">The scenario entails that due to the limited availability of fin-free friendly menus and the symbolism of shark fin as wealth and prosper in traditional Chinese culture , it is likely that a large proportion of Hong Kong’s family reunion
                    diners will be feeding on shark fin. However, research has shown that nearly 50% of the shark fin trade in Hong Kong is composed endangered shark species. Hongkongers’ eating habit has sped up the extinction of more rare shark species.</p>

                <h2>World Largest Shark Fin Trader</h2>
                <p class="major">Sharks are not commonly found in Hong Kong marine area, but shark fins are ubiquitous in the city’s dried seafood stores, hanging on the ceiling or placing inside glass jars neatly. Hong Kong is the world largest shark fin trading hub,
                    which accounts for about 40 percent of global shark fin trade annually, according to World Wildlife Fund. </p>
                <div class="row">

                </div>
                <p class="major">Not only is Hong Kong the top shark fin trader worldwide, its shark fin consumption is also tremendous. According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the net shark fin consumption of Hong Kong in 2011 is 191,485
                    tonnes after deducting its import volume with the export volume. </p>
                <p class="major">Yet, Hong Kong’s shark fin imports and re-exports have been decreasing, thanks to shipping bans on fin carriage and stricter international regulations on endangered species. The shark fin imports halved since 2007, which decreased from
                    10,210 tonnes to 4,979 in 2017. Re-exports also fell by 75 percent, which declined from 5,683 tonnes in 2007 to 1,434 in 2017.</p>

                <h2>Bloody Shark Finning</h2>
                <p class="major">According to the 2013 edition of Marine Policy, around 100 million sharks are killed every year to satisfy the demand for shark fins and meat. Yet, only 12 people were killed by shark in the peak year.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/ratio.gif"></img>
                </center>
                <p class="major">Due to the shark massacre, what human considered to be one of the world’s deadliest animals are now endangered. </p>
                <p class="major">The growth rate of sharks is slower than other fishes, leading to the delay of sexual maturity. Some breeds can only reproduce at 25 years old and their pregnancy will last for 22 months. It is also difficult for them to get pregnant,
                    and even if they do, only few baby sharks would be bornt. Therefore, when there is a sharp decline in the numbers of sharks, restoration is a tall order.</p>
                <p class="major">Worse still, in a SCMP’s news reporting, one third of the shark fin products sold in Hong Kong come from vulnerable or endangered species.</p>

                <h2>What Have Been Done and What Can Be Done</h2>
                <p class="major">The brutal practice of shark fin hunting has aroused round attention. Activists have adopted a variety of approaches of ceasing any more such cruel practices.
                </p>
                <p class="major">Hong Kong is a one of the main trade hub for shark fin. Hong Kong Shark foundation, together with other animal welfare groups, have been making exposure to the public and send the message of “Shark-free banquets”, since shark fin soup
                    is a routine cuisine in big occasions. They have engaged 25 companies from different walks of business and have them implement shark-free policy.</p>
                <p class="major"> However, the progress of shark in Hong Kong is rather slow. Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants (Amendment) Bill 2017 was finished with its scrutiny in late 2017, and is going to report to the Legco House Committee soon
                    in order to arrange for the resumption of the second reading of the bill. Killing shark is still not a crime in Hong Kong unless it is of endangered species. Law has already in practice in some other countries. The Shark Finning Prohibition
                    Act of 2000 (SFPA) was sign to ban finning on any fishing vessel within United States territorial waters, and in international waters. Shark fins could not be imported into the United States without the associated carcass. To contrast,
                    the market demand for shark fin is still not neglectable in Hong Kong. Currently at least 76 types of sharks and their products are being sold on the open market in Hong Kong.
                </p>
                <p class="major">There are international organisations who are contributing to curbing the brutal act. WildAid, an established environmental organisation based in San Francisco, stretched their limbs to other continents and protect the wild species by
                    lowering people’s interest and demand for wildlife products. One of their campaign strategies is to portray the cruelty of shark fin massacre in the mouth of Yao Ming, a Chinese celebrity, targeting the susceptible audience. This is
                    to raise the awareness of the crowd not to become any future buyer of shark fin so as to deter the killing. Other keen organisations, The Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International, are working many angles
                    to curb this cruel and ecologically devastating practice. They lobby corporates to governments for regulations to prohibit fishing vessels from finning sharks, educate consumers about the plight of sharks, and promote legislation that
                    bans the sale of and trade in shark fins, reducing the demand by reducing the market.
                </p>
                <p class="major">Shark finning is getting recognised as a world issue and it is gaining more support from governments. However, a lot more could be done to prevent more massacre from happening. Those susceptible countries and regions involved can step
                    up their act by passing law and enforcement to not only stop the hunting, but also to enlarge their scope of animal protection. The new generation should apprehend the unnecessity of serving shark fin soup in banquets since it has
                    zero nutrition value. They should get rid of the custom of having shark as cuisine in a way for celebration and wealth show-off. They should be educated that every species including sharks plays a crucial part in the ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="major">That should be the strategy for saving the sharks. That would be the strategy for saving the future</p>
