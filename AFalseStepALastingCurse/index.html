		    <h2>The Farmers Who Hate Raining</h2>
                <p class="major">In between the brownfield sites, where loaded trucks come in and out, two farmers are weeding under the daring sunlight. </p>
                <p class="major">“Fat Kei” organic farm in Ping Che, which is famous for their japanese melons, is owned by 83-year-old Law Sheung-fat and his 79-year-old wife, Law Man-fung. Although their eyes are milky and their skins are weather-worn, they have no
                    plan to retire.</p>
                <center>
                    <div class="image fit">
                        <img src="images/Couple.JPG" width="600" height="400"><br>
                        <p>83-year-old Law Sheung-fat and his 79-year-old wife, Law Man-fung are farmers of “Fat Kei” organic farm in Ping Che. They oversee changes in this area for 21 years.</p>

                </center>
                <p class="major">Their iron-sheet home guarded by two fierce dogs named “Health” and “Four Eyes” is right behind their farmland. This loving couple has been overseeing the changes in this area since 1996 - the pigsty next to the farmland has been turned
                    into an open storage, while the muddy roads have been covered with concrete.</p>
                <p class="major">Behind their smiles, they are still baffled by one problem - the rain. </p>
                <p class="major">“Whenever it is raining, water containing metal will flow from the nearby open storages,” said Mr. Law. “Our crops must be affected somehow.”</p>
                <p class="major">Sometimes, the farm floods because of the blocked sewers. “Sewage could be drained in the past when there were not many open storages, but now they all flow to my place when it is raining heavily, ” said Mrs. Law, moving her hands dramatically.
                </p>

                </center>

                <p class="major">Mr. Law have lost count of how many times he complained to the Lands Department. “The government said they cannot fix this problem because the lands are privately-owned. They need landlords’ permission,” he said.</p>
                <p class="major">This misfortune began with one error in Hong Kong’s town planning control mechanism.</p>

                <h2>A False Step</h2>
                <p class='major'>
                    In 1981, the Melhado Investment Ltd rented a private farmland in So Kwun Wat, New Territories. Instead of growing crops, they used it to store iron bars. The government then sued the company on the basis that the land had originally been zoned for agricultural
                    purposes.

                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Since the Outline Zoning Plan had not stipulated restriction of land uses clearly, the court’s ruling stated that landlords could do whatever they want as long as no structure was present. In other words, even if the operator opened a parking lot on a
                    private farmland, the official had no enforcement power against them.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Meanwhile, due to the growing logistic industry, the surging demand for storage sites led to the first wave of “brownfield bloom”. Many indigenous villagers rented their farmlands to businessmen for more profits.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    In Hong Kong, brownfield sites usually refer to farmlands which are converted into industrial use owing to the decline of agricultural industry. In the paper released by the Task Force on Land Supply, 1,300 hectares of brownfield sites is identified in
                    Hong Kong, including only the land uses that are commonly regarded as brownfield operation, such as open storage, container storage and vehicle parking lot.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    In 1990, the government introduced the Development Permission Area Plan under the Town Planning Ordinance, a zoning control that specifies land uses. The Lands Department was granted enforcement power in areas covered by the new plan to prosecute unauthorised
                    development in 2004.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>

                    Yet, the enforcement power does not cover brownfields with their use labelled as “existing use” - land uses that existed before the implementation of the new plan. Even if the land use fails to comply with what is stipulated on the plan, landowners will
                    not be prosecuted.
                </p>

                <h2>The Brownfield Hotspot – Hung Lung Hang and Ping Che</h2>
                <p class='major'>

                    The region near Hung Lung Hang has long been a conglomerate of brownfields. Liber Research Community, an independent research body in Hong Kong, identified 54 brownfield sites in that area. The satellite images from Google Earth Pro shows that most sites
                    have been operating since 2010.

                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Although the identified brownfield sites are located at lands which are zoned for agricultural uses in the Development Permission Area Plan, seven sites have not received any warning nor enforcement notice since 2000. They have occupied around 7.5 hectares
                    of lands, slightly bigger than Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate in Kwun Tong.

                    For the reminding 47 sites, only some parts of the area have enforcement records.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    The intention of the government to zone around 120 hectares for agricultural uses is to “retain and safeguard good quality farmland”. Those lands were also surrounded by extensive green belts.

                </p>
                <p class='major'>

                    The first Development Permission Area Plans of Hung Lung Hang and Ping Che were released in 1999, which means land uses existed on or before 1998 are allowed to sustain.

                    <p class='major'>

                        In the official aerial photos taken in 1998, other than the seven sites without enforcement records, there were constructions on most lands which are zoned for agricultural use as well which explained the partial enforcement records.

                <h2>Farmland Still Needed?</h2>
                <p class='major'>Chow Sung-ming, instructor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University specialising in land and planning policies, views farmland as an indispensable part of the whole rural ecosystem. "If you abuse the farmland for brownfield sites, the whole
                    New Territories will be totally different from before. You cannot maintain the original rural environment and the lifestyle of people there,” he explained.
                </p>
                <center>
                    <img src="images/IMG_5289.JPG" width="600" height="435">
                    <p>Chow Sung-ming, instructor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said farmland is an indispensable part of the rural ecosystem.
                    </p><br>
                </center>
                <p class='major'>Dr. Chow added that decreasing agricultural lands may harm the future generation as there is minimal local supply.“I think that is the problem, especially under climate change and the heavy environmental challenge in the world, we may
                    need to supply our food locally in the future,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Yet, Tang Kwan-shing, President of the Association of the New Territories Open Storage Operators Ltd., said the need for local agricultural industry has declined because of the cheaper crops imported from Mainland China. “Farmers still
                    needed to earn a living after the farmlands were vacant. Therefore, they converted them into open storages,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Yeung Ha-chi, member of Liber Research Community, said the seven brownfield sites in Hung Lung Hang have negative impacts on agricultural lands. “They are located too close to active agricultural lands and the brownfield sites using as
                    electronic waste dismantling do not have sewage facilities that would be harmful to the active agricultural lands nearby,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“If containers are piled up to a certain height, they would block the sunlight, obstructing the farming process,” Mr. Yeung added.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>In 2016 Policy Address, the government promised to set up the Agricultural Priority Area. It aims at prioritising lands for agricultural use in the future and avoiding them to be converted into brownfields.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>However, Dr. Chow said there is no clear plan on how the government implement the scheme or how much area will be covered. “It seems to be an empty promise,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“Some unofficial source said only around 1,000 hectares, which accounts for 25 percent of the agricultural lands in Hong Kong, will be preserved under the Agricultural Priority Area," said Dr. Chow. “It actually indirectly implies that
                    the rest will be be destroyed or converted to other uses.”
                </p>
                <p class='major'>In response to voices saying brownfields might be possible sites to develop housing units, he said that prioritising brownfield for housing will increase landlords’ intention of destroying their own farmland in order to be eligible for
                    housing development.

                <h2>Eroding The Green</h2>
                <p class='major'>From our observation, not only are most brownfield sites of "existing use" in Hung Lung Hang near to the green belt, some of them have even invaded its periphery. An obvious example would be Site F, where more than half of it is built
                    inside the green belt.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>According to the Town Planning Board, green belt acts as the buffer zone between ecological conservation area and urban development.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“The government cannot just turn the ecologically sensitive areas into brownfield sites at will like there is no consequence, and furthermore grant them the right to develop the area,” said Mr. Yeung. “If the situation continues, it will
                    become a potential threat to country parks and groves,” he said.
                </p>
                <center>
                    <img src="images/IMG_1689.JPG" width="600" height="410"><br>
                    <p>Yeung Ha-chi, member of Liber Research Community, said the government cannot convert the ecologically sensitive areas into brownfield sites without considering the negative environmental impacts.</p>
                </center>
                <p class='major'>However, Mr. Tang thinks most of the current brownfield sites do no harm to the adjacent environment. “Generally speaking, brownfield sites nowadays are already operated in an environmentally-friendly way. They are law-abiding, following
                    the government’s rules to green the areas, such as planting trees,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Ironically, in 2017, an environment impact assessment conducted in the Southern Yuen Long revealed that more than 650 brownfield sites potentially contaminate the soil. 90% of them are open storage and container storage, same as the common
                    land uses in the seven brownfield sites we spotted in Hung Lung Hang.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Looking through satellite images from Google Earth, there is nearly no greenery in these brownfield sites.

                <h2>Safety At Risk </h2>
                <p class='major'>Mr. Tang, as a representative of operators, said the current neighbourhood of brownfield sites suits the industry best.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“I think the operation of brownfield sites does totally no harm to the nearby residents,” he said. “We never disturb the residents”.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>In Mr. Tang’s opinion, the proximity of brownfield sites to residence benefits the local economy. Having job opportunities near to their homes, workers can go to work on foot. He pointed out that the convenience brings motivation to the
                    residents to work and it does not even affect the transportation.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Although Mr. Tang believes the industry co-exists with nearby residents in harmony, Hau Lai-ming, resident in Lei Uk Tsuen, did not find the way she lives next to brownfield sites friendly though.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“There are big trucks and containers going in and out every day,” she said, “It could cause danger to us.” She was walking on the same path as the trucks did on her way home.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>The area is not developed with fences and pedestrian roads. To both the villages and the brownfield sites, there is just one single road for everything - people, trucks, containers, construction materials… Everything that needs to be there
                    for the industry.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Similarly, there have been a lot of open storages near Fairview Park Boulevard in Yuen Long since 1990. The frequently passing trucks has long stirred up anger of residents nearby. In 2009, a 12-year-old boy riding on a bicycle was crashed
                    by a truck and died.

                <h2>Turning A Blind Eye</h2>
                <p class='major'>One of the key principles of law is that no person should be prosecuted for crimes that are unlawful at the time he or she committed it. Therefore, even with the Development Permission Area Plan under the Town Planning Ordinance, the official has no enforcement power against those brownfield sites existed in Hung Lung Hang before 1999.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>“Those structures existed before the law came into power, so they have the right to exist,” Lam Tze-kwan, a certified urban planner explained. “The government allowed illegal structures on small house (“Ting Uk”) which was constructed
                    before 1961 to exist due to the same reason.”
                </p>
                <p class='major'>When dealing with these brownfield sites, Ms. Lam said the government will always come up with a word – toleration. “If there is no big news about brownfields in Hung Lung Hang, such as the contamination of soil and water there by their
                    operations, the government will not do anything and just keep them as what they are now,” she said.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>Although Mr. Yeung recognises the difficulties of prosecution after the Melhado case, he said there must be a way to regulate brownfields by imposing other policies. “I hold strong to my belief that the government cares about the economy
                    more than the environment,” he said. “The poor policy of the government also sacrifices our environment and the health of residents nearby.”

                </p>
                <p class='major'>In his opinion, the “brownfield bloom” began with government’s goal to develop entrepot trade in Hong Kong. Businessmen turned to farmlands in the New Territories since the lands the government zoned for the logistic industry were inadequate,
                    encouraging the emergence of brownfield sites.
                </p>
                <p class='major'>When asked about whether it is a political decision to allow brownfield sites existed before the first Development Permission Area Plan to continue their operation, Mr. Tang said he has no idea, but he believes that brownfields do serve
                    a vital role in Hong Kong’s economic development.

                <h2>The Way Out</h2>
                <p class='major'>
                    Ms. Lam said relocating the brownfield sites which had registered their “existing use” could be the way out. “It will not violate the Town Planning Ordinance because those brownfield sites are still “existing use”,” she said. </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    River Trade Terminal in Tuen Mun is recommended by Mr. Yeung for relocation because of its low-usage rate and high proximity to pier with effective transport networks. He said region near the landfill is another appropriate spot, especially for operations
                    like waste recycling yards. “It will create a good transport chain in which the recyclable items are transported to the recycling yards, while the non-recyclable ones are sent directly to the landfill,” Mr. Yeung explained. </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Yet, Mr. Tang said the government still cannot find a suitable place for relocation after prolonged discussion with the brownfield industry, and residents near the chosen location may not welcome the decision.</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    “Our current location, which is a rural region near the port of entry, is the most suitable and convenient for logistics,” said Mr. Tang.</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Mr. Chow suggested converting the brownfield sites in "existing use" back to agricultural lands by reducing their pollution. “There may be grey area related to the land use, but there is no grey area in regulating pollution,” he said. “We should always
                    open up the possibility for the landlords or tenants to get rid of the pollutants so that it may potentially become farmland again.”</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    “Actually there are a lot of practicable ways for rehabilitation," Mr. Yeung said, adding that growing bean plants is a simple way to restore soil fertility.</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Mr. Tang is skeptical about the counter-conversion of land use due to the decline of agricultural industry. “Is the younger generation willing to plant vegetables laboriously?” he doubted. </p>
                <p class='major'>
                    “Brownfields are crucial to the citizens, the society and the economy,” said Mr. Tang. “If the government redeem those ‘existing use’ sites, thousands of workers will lose their jobs, leading to social instability. Brownfields also provide lands for transports
                    and logistics, which is the economic artery of Hong Kong.”</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Law have already given up on the renovation of sewers. “We had already complained for so many times, so what can we do now? They [the government] said they cannot fix it,” said Mrs. Law.</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    “Waiting is all we can do.”</p>
                <p class='major'>
                    Another day passed by, they hope it would not rain too soon.
